Google protobuf support for Lua
-------------------------------
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/starwing/lua-protobuf.svg?branch=c_impl)](https://travis-ci.org/starwing/lua-protobuf)

This project offers a simple C library for basic protobuf wire format
encode/decode, it splits to several modules:
  - pb.decoder: a wire format decode module.
  - pb.buffer:  a buffer implement that use to encode basic types into
                protobuf's wire format. It also can be used to support
		streaming decode protobuf data.
  - pb.conv:    a module to convert between integers in protobuf.
  - pb.io:      a module to support binary mode read/write to stdin/stdout.

It also has a high level Lua module to direct decode protobuf data to Lua
table, or encode Lua table to protobuf data. It uses pb_typeinfo.lua to
understand protobuf's compiled descriptor file format.

To support new protobuf type, you can use pb.load()/pb.loadfile() to load a
compiled protobuf schema file, generated by Google protobuf's protoc compiler.
You can also directly load a DescriptorProto message with pb.loadproto().

To reuse the loaded stuff, you can use pb.dump() to save loaded data to a
file. It's just a regular Lua module. After require() it, use pb.merge() to
include it into protobuf type database.

The detailed documentations are work-in-progress. But use it is very simple,
just try pb.decode(data, type) function or pb.encode(buff, type).
